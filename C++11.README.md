# C++11 Support

This branch is a prototype C++11 branch. I intend to work on full
C++11 compatability and idiomatic modern C++ style, and eventually
make this branch the master, when Visual Studio with C++11 support is
more widely deployed.

Currently, however, this branch should be considered experimental, and
more Linux oriented.
